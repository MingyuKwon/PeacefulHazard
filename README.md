About This Game
This is a survival adventure game inspired by Resident Evil 2, but without the horror element.

The player receives a mission to find treasure, exploring vast stages, solving puzzles, and either avoiding or defeating enemies while trying to escape.

Strategic gameplay is required due to the limited resources and inventory system, offering tension and a sense of challenge without relying on fear.
